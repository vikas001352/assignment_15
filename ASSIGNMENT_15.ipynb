    "SQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Structure: SQL databases use a structured schema that defines the tables, columns, and relationships between data elements. They adhere to a fixed schema, meaning the data must conform to the predefined structure.\n",
    "Data Model: SQL databases follow the relational data model, organizing data into tables with rows and columns. The relationships between tables are established through primary and foreign keys.\n",
    "Query Language: SQL databases use SQL, a standardized language for managing relational databases. SQL provides powerful querying capabilities, allowing users to perform complex operations like joins, aggregations, and transactions.\n",
    "ACID Compliance: SQL databases typically adhere to ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, ensuring reliable and consistent transactions. ACID compliance guarantees data integrity and reliability, but it can impact scalability in certain scenarios.\n",
    "Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server are popular SQL database systems.\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Structure: NoSQL databases have a flexible schema or schemaless design. They are often referred to as \"schema-less\" databases as they don't enforce a fixed structure, allowing for more dynamic and agile data models.\n",
    "Data Model: NoSQL databases use various data models, including key-value, document, column-family, and graph. Each model serves different use cases and provides unique data storage and retrieval capabilities.\n",
    "Query Language: NoSQL databases have their own query languages or APIs that are specific to the data model they employ. These languages offer different querying paradigms than SQL, with some emphasizing simplicity and performance.\n",
    "Scalability and Performance: NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally and handle large amounts of data with high throughput and low latency. They prioritize scalability and performance over strict data consistency in some cases.\n",
    "Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, CouchDB, and Neo4j are popular NoSQL database systems.\n",
    "The choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on various factors, including data structure, scalability requirements, performance needs, and the nature of the application. SQL databases are well-suited for structured data and complex transactions, while NoSQL databases excel in handling unstructured or semi-structured data, massive scalability, and flexible data models.\n",

    "Here's an explanation of the DDL statements CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE, along with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE:\n",
    "The CREATE statement is used to create new database objects, such as tables, indexes, views, or procedures.\n",
    "Example: Creating a table in a SQL database.\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Employees (\n",
    "    id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    name VARCHAR(100),\n",
    "    age INT,\n",
    "    salary DECIMAL(10, 2)\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP:\n",
    "The DROP statement is used to remove or delete existing database objects, such as tables, indexes, or views.\n",
    "Example: Dropping a table from a SQL database.\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP TABLE Employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER:\n",
    "The ALTER statement is used to modify the structure of an existing database object, such as adding or modifying columns in a table.\n",
    "Example: Adding a column to a table in a SQL database.\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER TABLE Employees\n",
    "ADD COLUMN email VARCHAR(255);\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE:\n",
    "The TRUNCATE statement is used to remove all rows from a table, but unlike the DROP statement, it keeps the table structure intact.\n",
    "Example: Truncating a table in a SQL database\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the TRUNCATE statement is used to remove all rows from the \"Employees\" table, effectively deleting all the data within the table. However, the table structure remains unaffected, and the table can still be used for future data insertion.\n",
    "\n",
    "These DDL statements (CREATE, DROP, ALTER, TRUNCATE) are crucial for defining, modifying, and managing the structure of database objects. They provide the necessary tools to create tables, add or remove columns, modify object properties, and manage the overall schema of a database system.\n",

    "\n",
    "INSERT INTO Employees (id, name, age, salary)\n",
    "VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 30, 50000.00);\n",

    "The most commonly used DQL statement is SELECT, which is used to fetch data from one or more tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an explanation of the SELECT statement with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT:\n",
    "The SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database. It allows you to specify which columns to include in the result, apply filtering conditions, perform calculations, and join multiple tables to retrieve data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Retrieving data from a table in a SQL database\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT id, name, age, salary\n",
    "FROM Employees\n",
    "WHERE age > 25;\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the SELECT statement retrieves data from the \"Employees\" table. The statement specifies the columns (id, name, age, salary) that should be included in the result set. The FROM clause indicates the table from which the data is retrieved. The WHERE clause is used to filter the records based on the condition specified (age > 25).\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of the SELECT statement is a set of rows that satisfy the specified conditions. This result set can be used for various purposes such as displaying the data, performing calculations, or further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT statements offer powerful features and capabilities, including aggregations, sorting, grouping, joining multiple tables, and more. They allow you to retrieve specific data based on conditions and extract valuable information from the database. SELECT statements form the backbone of data retrieval in SQL databases.\n",

    "Primary Key:\n",
    "A primary key is a column or a combination of columns in a database table that uniquely identifies each row or record in the table. It provides a way to uniquely identify and access specific rows in a table. The primary key enforces data integrity by ensuring that each row has a unique identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key characteristics of a primary key:\n",
    "\n",
    "Uniqueness: Each value in the primary key column(s) must be unique. No two rows can have the same primary key value.\n",
    "Non-nullability: The primary key column(s) cannot contain null values. It must have a value for every row in the table.\n",
    "Immutable: The primary key value(s) should not change once a row is inserted into the table or once it is established as the primary key.\n",
    "Single-valued: A primary key can consist of one or multiple columns, but the values in the primary key should uniquely identify a single row.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider a table named \"Customers\" with columns \"CustomerID\" and \"Name\". To make \"CustomerID\" the primary key, you would specify it as follows:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    CREATE TABLE Customers (\n",
    "    CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    Name VARCHAR(100),\n",
    "    -- other columns\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Foreign Key:\n",
    "A foreign key is a column or a combination of columns in a database table that establishes a link or a relationship between two tables. It represents a reference to the primary key of another table, creating a relationship between the two tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key characteristics of a foreign key:\n",
    "\n",
    "Referential Integrity: The foreign key ensures that the values in the foreign key column(s) match the values in the primary key column(s) of the referenced table. It maintains the referential integrity of the database.\n",
    "Relationship: A foreign key establishes a relationship between two tables, often indicating a parent-child relationship or a relationship based on some logical association between the data.\n",
    "Multiple Occurrences: Multiple rows in the table containing the foreign key can refer to the same primary key in the referenced table, allowing for one-to-many or many-to-many relationships.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider two tables, \"Orders\" and \"Customers\", where \"Orders\" has a foreign key relationship with the \"Customers\" table based on the \"CustomerID\" column:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    CREATE TABLE Customers (\n",
    "    CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    Name VARCHAR(100),\n",
    "    -- other columns\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Orders (\n",
    "    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    CustomerID INT,\n",
    "    -- other columns\n",
    "    FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID)\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the \"Orders\" table has a foreign key \"CustomerID\" that references the primary key \"CustomerID\" in the \"Customers\" table. This establishes a relationship between the two tables, allowing for efficient retrieval and linking of orders with their respective customers\n",
